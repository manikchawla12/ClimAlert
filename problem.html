        <h3><b>EARTHQUAKE</b></h3>
        

        <p>When there is sudden movement on the Earth's crust, earthquakes occur. Earthquakes are caused due to sudden lateral or vertical movements in the crust of the Earth. Or we can say that when tectonic plates ride over the other and cause the collision of orogeny or mountain building. The largest faults are formed on the surface of the Earth due to boundaries between moving plates.  When there is relative motion between the plates, it is more severe. It is estimated that the energy about 80% is released in the earthquakes that come from those whose epicentres are in this belt.

        <h3><b> FLODDING</b></h3>
        <p>
            Flood is one of the most dangerous natural disasters. It happens when excessive water is collected in any area. It usually happens due to heavy rainfall. India is highly prone to flood. There are many regions in the country that face this natural disaster because of the overflowing of rivers. Moreover, it also happens because of the melting of snow. Another reason for floods is when the dam breaks down. If we look at the coastal areas, the hurricanes and tsunamis are held responsible for causing floods. In this essay on flood, we will see the prevention and after-affect of flood.
