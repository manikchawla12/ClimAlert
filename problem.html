        <h3><b>EARTHQUAKE</b></h3>
        

        <p>When there is sudden movement on the Earth's crust, earthquakes occur. Earthquakes are caused due to sudden lateral or vertical movements in the crust of the Earth. Or we can say that when tectonic plates ride over the other and cause the collision of orogeny or mountain building. The largest faults are formed on the surface of the Earth due to boundaries between moving plates.  When there is relative motion between the plates, it is more severe. It is estimated that the energy about 80% is released in the earthquakes that come from those whose epicentres are in this belt.

        <h3><b> FLODDING</b></h3>
        <p>
            Flood is one of the most dangerous natural disasters. It happens when excessive water is collected in any area. It usually happens due to heavy rainfall. India is highly prone to flood. There are many regions in the country that face this natural disaster because of the overflowing of rivers. Moreover, it also happens because of the melting of snow. Another reason for floods is when the dam breaks down. If we look at the coastal areas, the hurricanes and tsunamis are held responsible for causing floods. In this essay on flood, we will see the prevention and after-affect of flood.

        <h3><b> GLOBAL WARMING</b> </h3>
        <p> Global warming is the average temperature of Earth has increases since 1950 until now the temperature continuing increasing. Global warming can also refers to climate change that causes an increase in the average of temperature. However global warming are causes by natural events and human that are believed to be contribute to increase in average temperatures
            Global warming is a serious issue and is not a single issue but a number of environmental issues. Global warming is a rise in the surface temperature of the earth that has changed various life forms on the earth. The issues that cause global warming are divided into two categories include “natural” and “human influences” of global warming.
