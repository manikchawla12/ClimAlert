Team The Bug Slayers started Climalert – A platform to tackle all drastic climate changes with innovative solutions.
 
Our platform tackles problems that cause climate change and their solution to help the mankind and comes up with the power to save our planet, as well as, pave way for a safer future for generations to come.

Overview:

Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment and health of people. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.

Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.

- Co2  increasing at 416 ppm
- Global temperature  increasing at 2.1°F since 1880
- Ice glaciers decreasing 13.3% per decade
- Ice sheets 428 billion Metric tons year 
- Sea level increasing 3.3 mm per year 

“Science is telling us that the climate crisis is accelerating, and the world must adapt. Innovation is needed, and Team The Bug Slayers believe that developers can leverage open-source technologies including AI, Cloud, and IoT to create solutions to take on the world’s most pressing issue of Climate Change. We look forward to groundbreaking ideas that can transform the world into a safer, greener future.”

To avoid destruction due to natural calamities and drastic climate change that cause loss of environment we came up with this platform Climalert to tackle the single largest challenge in the face of humanity— Climate Change using Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things.

- Pre Earthquake detection 
- To tackle CO2 emission
- Flood control detection
- Global warming detection 
- Check   underground water level 
- Check humidity, pressure  
- Heavy rain alerts
- Water Scarcity alerts
- and much more.

Our platform will keep improving continuously to help people and to save the earth.
