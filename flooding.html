        <h3><b> FLOODING</b></h3>
        <p>
          1. Introduce better flood warning systems:-<br>
         
          
          2. Modify homes and businesses to help them withstand floods:-<br>
          The focus should be on “flood resilience” rather than defence schemes, according to Laurence Waterhouse, director of civil engineering flood consultancy Pell Frischmann. He advised concreting floors and replacing materials such as MDF and plasterboard with more robust alternatives<br>
          
          3.Construct buildings above flood levels:-<br>
          Britain should construct all new buildings one metre from the ground to prevent flood damage, the former president of the Institution of Civil Engineers has suggested.<br> 
          
          4.Tackle climate change:-<br>
          Climate change has contributed to a rise in extreme weather events, scientists believe. Earlier this month the leader of the Green Party, Natalie Bennett, welcomed the landmark Paris Agreement<br>
          
          5.Increase spending on flood defences:-<br>
          Figures produced by the House of Commons library suggest that real terms spending on flood defences has fallen by 20 per cent since David Cameron came to power<br>
          
          6.Protect wetlands and introduce plant trees strategically:-<br>
          The creation of more wetlands – which can act as sponges, soaking up moisture – and wooded areas can slow down waters when rivers overflow. These areas are often destroyed to make room for agriculture and development, the WWF said.<br>
          
          7.Restore rivers to their natural courses:-<br>
          Many river channels have been historically straightened to improve navigability. Remeandering straightened rivers by introducing their bends once more increases their length and can delay the flood flow and reduce the impact of the flooding downstream<br>
          
          8.Introduce water storage areas:-<br>
          Following the severe flooding of 2009 a £5.6 million flood alleviation scheme was established in Thacka Beck, on the outskirts of Penrith, Cumbria. More than 675 metres of culverts underneath the streets of Penrith were replaced and a 76,000m³ flood storage reservoir – the equivalent of 30 Olympic sized swimming pools<br> 
          
          9.Improve soil conditions:-<br>
          Inappropriate soil management, machinery and animal hooves can cause soil to become compacted so that instead of absorbing moisture, holding it and slowly letting it go, water runs off it immediately<br>
          
          
          10.Put up more flood barriers:-<br>
          The Environment Agency uses a range of temporary or “demountable” defences in at-risk areas. These can be removed completely when waters recede. Temporary barriers can also be added to permanent flood defences, such as raised embankments, increasing the level of protection. “As the threat and frequency of flood risk increases, the use of passive flood defence has to be the only realistic long term solution,” <br>
